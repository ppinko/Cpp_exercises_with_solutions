"I actually didn't go with a name on the back of my jersey," 
James said on a video conference call with reporters. "It was 
no disrespect to the list that was handed out to all the players. 
I commend anyone that decides to put something on the back of 
their jersey. It's just something that didn't really seriously 
resonate with my mission, with my goal.

"I would have loved to have a say-so on what would have went on 
the back of my jersey. I had a couple things in mind, but 
I wasn't part of that process, which is OK. I'm absolutely OK 
with that. ... I don't need to have something on the back of my 
jersey for people to understand my mission or know what I'm 
about and what I'm here to do."
