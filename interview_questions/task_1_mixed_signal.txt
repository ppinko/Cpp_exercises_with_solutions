Task 1


Implementation Task
 
Two real valued signals are given as:

1. A sine wave with a frequency of 10 Hz, an amplitude of 3 and a phase offset of 90°.
2. A symmetrical square wave with a frequency of 40 Hz, an amplitude of 1 and a phase offset of 0°.

1. Both signals shall be sampled with a sampling frequency of 200 Hz (for a duration of 1 second) into a data buffer and printed to the screen.
2. Create a third mixed signal by multiplying both, print it as well.
3. Compute the mean of the mixed signals first quarter (the first 0.25 seconds) and the integral of the second quarter. Print the results as well.
