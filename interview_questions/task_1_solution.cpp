/*
Implementation Task
 
Two real valued signals are given as:

1. A sine wave with a frequency of 10 Hz, an amplitude of 3 and a phase offset of 90째.
2. A symmetrical square wave with a frequency of 40 Hz, an amplitude of 1 and a phase offset of 0째.

1. Both signals shall be sampled with a sampling frequency of 200 Hz (for a duration of 1 second) 
into a data buffer and printed to the screen.
2. Create a third mixed signal by multiplying both, print it as well.
3. Compute the mean of the mixed signals first quarter (the first 0.25 seconds) and the integral 
of the second quarter. Print the results as well.
*/

/*
IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS:
a) It was assumed that sampling with a frequency of 200 Hz started at time = 0 s, and ended 
at time = 0.995 s. In total 200 measuring points.
b) Mean of first quarter was calculated as mean of first 50 points.
c) Integral of second quarter was calculated as integral of points in range 51-100 inclusive.
