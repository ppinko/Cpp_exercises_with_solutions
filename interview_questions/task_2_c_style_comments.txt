Task 2

Problem-solving task

C++ supports two kinds of comments, C-style comments (/* comment */) and C++ comments (// comment). 
C-style comments can span multiple lines, while C++ comments end at the end of the line.

Write a small word processor that reads a C++ source file and replaces C-style comments with C++ comments, if possible. 
If a C-style comment does not end at the end of a line (ignoring whitespaces), it needs to be kept. 
For simplicity’s sake, C++ syntax rules are not to be considered, including nested comments.

Example given:

/*
 This is a sample C++ file.
 */

#include <stdio.h> /* for printf */

int main(int argc, char const* argv[]) // the entry function

{
  printf(“Hello World! 1+1=%d\n”, 1+1 /* compute 1+1 */ );
  return 0;
}

Is turned into:

//
// This is a sample C++ file.
//

#include <stdio.h> // for printf

int main(int argc, char const* argv[]) // the entry function
{
  printf(“Hello World! 1+1=%d\n”, 1+1 /* compute 1+1 */ );
  return 0;
}

Note: For both tasks, use standard C++14 to solve the given tasks.
